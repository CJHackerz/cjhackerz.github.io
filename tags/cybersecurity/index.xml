      <description>Previously I was working on university minor project (IPS system for IoT devices). So, I have picked up CVE-2017-7650 to define snort rule for it. I was thinking how someone can leverage this silly vulnerability and I asked my self in current IoT space what kind of data can compromise user&amp;rsquo;s privacy. Yes, it is GPS data. I am big fan of Python programming and wanted to use it&amp;rsquo;s power, so I wrote to small python scripts which gathers list of IP addresses from Shodan API, tries to connect on those IPs as MQTT client.</description>
