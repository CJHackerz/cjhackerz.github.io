      <description>startx Well if your have been into hacking since around 2012 you know the above headline is a linux command. I got taste of hacking/cybersecurity when I was very young teen. Teen from a middle class family who can&amp;rsquo;t afford to have internet connection over WiFi. Since in early days in India before Jio was a thing internet connection prices were high and one can only go to cyber cafe for 2-3 hours to surf internet.</description>

      <description>Story It was yet another boring day in COVID-19 lockdown and I was checking my Linkedin. Did not knew small surprise connection request is waiting. It was from one of the Co-founders of ReFirm Labs Mr. Terry Dunlap. Without hesitation I accepted request and started talking, he has very humble personality with years of experience in cybersecurity. In between conversation I mentioned binwalk and that I use it for day to day manual firmware analysis.</description>

      <title>Reading data from EEPROM without desoldering</title>

      <description>Introduction In IoT/Hardware security it is common practice of dumping firmware/bootloader data inorder to perform reverse engineering for closed source system applications.
Well known easiest way is to download .bin/.zip (packed firmware) files from device manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s website which they provide to end users for firmware upgrade operations. And later us hackers/security researchers throw these files to reverse engineering softwares such as binwalk to check it&amp;rsquo;s contents and extract the needed stuff.</description>

      <title>UART using Bus Pirate</title>

      <description>Introduction UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter. It&amp;rsquo;s not a communication protocol like SPI and I2C, but rather a physical circuit which transmits and receives serial data.
UART transmit data asynchronously, which means there is no clock signal to synchronize the output of bits from the transmitting UART to the sampling of bits by the receiving UART. Instead of a clock signal, the transmitting UART adds start and stop bits to the data packet being transferred.</description>

      <title>Mqtt pwn</title>

      <description>Previously I was working on university minor project (IPS system for IoT devices). So, I have picked up CVE-2017-7650 to define snort rule for it. I was thinking how someone can leverage this silly vulnerability and I asked my self in current IoT space what kind of data can compromise user&amp;rsquo;s privacy. Yes, it is GPS data. I am big fan of Python programming and wanted to use it&amp;rsquo;s power, so I wrote to small python scripts which gathers list of IP addresses from Shodan API, tries to connect on those IPs as MQTT client.</description>
